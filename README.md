# First-Online-Restaurant-
This was the first self project I coded myself as a starter. I did for a local restuarant, which sadly didn't see the light of day. 
My first self project in 2017. Initially intended writing it fully in Vanilla, but ended up throwing in a little bit of JQuery.
It is not the best project, but as a starter, I was quite impressed with it!
